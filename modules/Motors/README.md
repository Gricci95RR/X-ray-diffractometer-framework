# Motors Module

This module is used wrap the two libraries used to control respectively stepper motors ("ximc" library <https://github.com/EPC-MSU/libximc>) and hexapod robot (library "hxp_drivers" <https://www.newport.com/>).

The interfaces of which the module is composed are:
1. "IMotor": interface used to communicate with stepper motors using ximc 8SMC4 and 8SMC5 controllers;
2. "IHXP": interface used to communicate with the Newport hexapod robot.
